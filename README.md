# Quicksort Pivots

in the lectures I only briefly mentioned strategies for determining a good pivot
for quicksort. The implementation on the slides simply picks the leftmost
element in the part of the array that we consider as a pivot. I also mentioned a
few other ways of picking a good pivot, e.g. randomly.

Median-of-three is also a good way of picking a pivot -- inspect the first,
middle, and last elements of the part of the array under consideration and
choose the median value. Using the probabilities for picking a pivot in a
particular part of the array (in the same way as we did on slide 34), argue
whether this method is more or less (or equally) likely to pick a good pivot
compared to simply choosing the first element. Assume that all permutations are
equally likely, i.e. the input array is ordered randomly.

Your answer must derive probabilities for choosing a good pivot and
quantitatively reason with them.

Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.


Choosing the first element of a list/array gives you a $1/2$ probability of choosing a "good pivot" (one that will divide the array in to two nearly equal parts), by using the median-of-three method, your probability is $1/3$, while this is less likely to choose a good pivot (one in three as opposed to one in two tries), it is commonly used for the fact that it reduces the occurrences in which you get a very large/small(not good) pivot, all while satisfying the $3n/4$ size restriction, as $n/3$ < $3n/4$.
